Hey guys, it's SliceCast here. This tutorial is for Advanced Modders who wants to step up their games to get better! Could be for newbies too.
I will show you some basics examples on how to hook a function.

Now let's say our Type Functions are (int, float, bool, double) and that we're doing a int/integer type.

C++:
//the void *instance is a self-created variable.
int (*old_Kills)(void *instance);
int Kills(void *instance) {
    //Check if instance is NULL to prevent CRASH
    if (instance != NULL)
    {
        return 99999; //Return how many value
    }
    //return the original value (this code isn't really needed if you have a toggle/switch)
    return old_Kills(instance);
}
Also make sure to call your hooks with MsHook or your mod won't work.
Example:
C++:
MsHookFunction((void*)getAbsoluteAddress(OFFSETS), (void*)Kills, (void**)&old_Kills);
If it's a bool, then simple. Just return/put "true" or "false".

If it's a float, then return a 99.0 or whatever.

This is way better than Patching. We don't need to use Hex Values for hooking. Hooking is way better, you can return any value you want.

I might make tutorial on how to do Function Pointers and Strings, but as of now just learn this.
